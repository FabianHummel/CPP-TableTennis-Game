Inspired by [**Twini-Golf**](https://polymars.itch.io/twini-golf) by Polymars, this project is a work in progress Table Tennis game made in SDL3 (C++).
This is my first C++ project ever, and I made this game to mainly learn the language and try out an artstyle I haven't used before. The code may also contain a lot of memory leaks, but I don't really give a 🦆.
More information can be read in my articles about this game [here](https://fabianhummel.dev/#/book/table-tennis.md)!

### 📚 Libraries
This project takes advantage of the [**SDL3.0 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) Framework**](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/FrontPage/) together with the extensions [**SDL_image**](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3_image/FrontPage), [**SDL_mixer**](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3_mixer/FrontPage) and
[**SDL_ttf**](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3_ttf/FrontPage), as well as
[**ENet**](https://github.com/zpl-c/enet) for peer-to-peer multiplayer!

### 📦 Download
Currently, there are no pre built binaries of the game available to download, but I'll try to package it for all major operating systems when I get to it. However, building from source is just as easy!

### ⚠️ Remarks
Because I'm using a retina display, the game may not be optimized for other displays. (The game calculates with only half the resolution, so on 'normal displays' the textures may only fill up a quarter of the screen).

### 🎯 Coming soon
* Versus Computer
* Multiplayer
* Fancy ass music
